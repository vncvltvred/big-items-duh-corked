### Obviously They're Enlarged Items!
##### (also known as Big Items, Duh! Corked)

###### 1. Why is it also known as (Big Items, Duh! Corked), you may ask? 

Well, simply put, it's a fork of the original mod with added compatibility for EMi. It also contains an enlarged item for EMis Recipe Screen (Where you find out recipes for items) which REis compat doesn't have. Therefore, Corked = Compat + Forked. Also, you can transpose the X, and Y pos of the enlarged item for both recipe and main screen. Not only that but if you don't like the Recipe Screen for EMi having an Enlarged item (or it causes problems, since it mixins into another mod), well you can disable it.

###### 2. Why should you choose this over the original?

If you don't use EMi, you get a little bit of some extra features. Though, the EMi compat is where OTEI[^1] really shines. Mod size is also optimized from 770KB to 119KB, we love optimization!
