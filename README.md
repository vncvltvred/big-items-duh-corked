##### (also known as Big items, duh! Corked)

### Probably FAQ

###### 1. Why is it also known as (Big items, duh! Corked)?

Well, simply put, it's a fork of the original mod with extended compatibility for EMi and its addons. It also contains an enlarged item for EMis Recipe Screen (where you find out recipes for items) which REis compat doesn't have. Therefore, Corked = Compat + Forked. Also, you can transpose the X, and Y pos of the enlarged item for both recipe and main screen, plus some other configuration not mentioned.

###### 2. Why should you choose this over the original?

If you don't use EMi, you get a little bit of some extra features, plus tiny, miniscule even, optimizations to how REI's compat was handled. Though, the EMi compat is where OTEI[^1] really shines. Mod size is also lowered from 770KB to 119KB.

###### 3. Who's OTEI(Odie)?

That one dog garf clowns on, you know the one (probably).
